Fundamentals of Query Tuning: sp_BlitzCache Lab Setup
v1.0 - 2019-06-30
https://www.BrentOzar.com/go/queryfund
This demo requires:
* Any supported version of SQL Server
* Any Stack Overflow database: https://www.BrentOzar.com/go/querystack
Before running this setup script, restore the Stack Overflow database.
This script will take a couple of minutes to create indexes & stored procs.
