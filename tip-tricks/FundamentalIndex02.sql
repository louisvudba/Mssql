Fundamentals of Index Tuning: WHERE + ORDER BY Lab
v1.1 - 2019-06-03
https://www.BrentOzar.com/go/indexfund
This demo requires:
* Any supported version of SQL Server
* Any Stack Overflow database: https://www.BrentOzar.com/go/querystack
This first RAISERROR is just to make sure you don't accidentally hit F5 and
run the entire script. You don't need to run this:
*/
RAISERROR(N'Oops! No, don''t just hit F5. Run these demos one at a time.', 20, 1) WITH LOG;
GO
DropIndexes;
GO
/* It leaves clustered indexes in place though. */
/* ****************************************************************************
FIRST LAB CHALLENGE: design the right index for this:
*/
SELECT TOP 100 DisplayName, Location, WebsiteUrl, Reputation, Id
  FROM dbo.Users
  WHERE Location <> ''
    AND WebsiteUrl <> ''
  ORDER BY Reputation DESC;
GO
/* 
Which field should go first in the WHERE clause?
Which filter is more selective?
*/
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfRowsInTheTable FROM dbo.Users;
SELECT COUNT(*) /* TOP 100 DisplayName, Location, WebsiteUrl, Reputation, Id */
  FROM dbo.Users
  WHERE Location <> '' /*
    AND WebsiteUrl <> ''
  ORDER BY Reputation DESC */;
SELECT COUNT(*) /* TOP 100 DisplayName, Location, WebsiteUrl, Reputation, Id */
  FROM dbo.Users
  WHERE /* Location <> ''
    AND */ WebsiteUrl <> ''
  /* ORDER BY Reputation DESC; */
GO
/* 
Hmmm - neither of those are very selective, although WebsiteUrl wins.
What about the top 100 by Reputation descending? Do most of those users have
their Location and WebsiteUrl filled out?
*/
SELECT TOP 100 *
  FROM dbo.Users
  ORDER BY Reputation DESC;
GO
/* 
Ooo! A lot of them do! Strangely, we might be able to lead with Reputation in
this unusual case. Try one with Reputation leading, and one with WebsiteUrl
leading:
*/
CREATE INDEX IX_Reputation_WebsiteUrl_Location_Includes
  ON dbo.Users(Reputation, WebsiteUrl, Location)
  INCLUDE (DisplayName);
CREATE INDEX IX_WebsiteUrl_Location_Reputation_Includes
  ON dbo.Users(WebsiteUrl, Location, Reputation)
  INCLUDE (DisplayName);
GO
/* Then test your queries, BUT ASK YOURSELF FIRST, which ones of these will
have a sort in their execution plan? */
SET STATISTICS IO ON;
SELECT TOP 100 DisplayName, Location, WebsiteUrl, Reputation, Id
  FROM dbo.Users WITH (INDEX = 1) /* Clustered index */
  WHERE Location <> ''
    AND WebsiteUrl <> ''
  ORDER BY Reputation DESC;
SELECT TOP 100 DisplayName, Location, WebsiteUrl, Reputation, Id
  FROM dbo.Users WITH (INDEX = IX_Reputation_WebsiteUrl_Location_Includes)
  WHERE Location <> ''
    AND WebsiteUrl <> ''
  ORDER BY Reputation DESC;
SELECT TOP 100 DisplayName, Location, WebsiteUrl, Reputation, Id
  FROM dbo.Users WITH (INDEX = IX_WebsiteUrl_Location_Reputation_Includes)
  WHERE Location <> ''
    AND WebsiteUrl <> ''
  ORDER BY Reputation DESC;
GO
/* The one leading with Reputation is the winner here.
On the one leading with WebsiteUrl, we get a sort in the plan, even though the
Reputation field is in the keys. To understand why, use our index visualization
technique - write a SELECT query that matches what's in the index:
*/
SELECT WebsiteUrl, Location, Reputation
  FROM dbo.Users WITH (INDEX = IX_WebsiteUrl_Location_Reputation_Includes)
  WHERE Location <> ''
    AND WebsiteUrl <> ''
  ORDER BY WebsiteUrl, Location, Reputation;
GO
/* See the problem? Reputation is all over the place because our index is
sorted first by WebsiteUrl, then Location. Reputation being the third key isn't
all that useful here.
What if we don't pass in a hint - which index does SQL Server choose?
*/
SELECT TOP 100 DisplayName, Location, WebsiteUrl, Reputation, Id
  FROM dbo.Users
  WHERE Location <> ''
    AND WebsiteUrl <> ''
  ORDER BY Reputation DESC;
GO
/* Whew. Drop the index that we decide not to use, and then keep going. 
Remember, as you work through the exercises, I want you to aim for 5 or less 
indexes per table, with around 5 or less fields per index. You're up! */
DROP INDEX dbo.Users.IX_WebsiteUrl_Location_Reputation_Includes;
GO
/* ****************************************************************************
FIRST UP: We want to start encouraging people to review other folks' work and
upvote it. To do that, let's find the most recently created users who haven't
cast an UpVote yet. Then, build the right index for it.
You write the query. Go for it!
*/
/* ****************************************************************************
NEXT CHALLENGE: User Id #22656 is lonely. Let's build a dating service query to
find all of the people who live in his country. He'll probably want to find
friendly people, so let's filter for a few things:
*/
SELECT DisplayName, Location, Reputation, WebsiteUrl, Id
  FROM dbo.Users
  WHERE Age > 21
    AND (Location LIKE '%United Kingdom%' OR Location LIKE '%UK%')
    AND DownVotes < 1000
    AND UpVotes > 1
  ORDER BY Reputation DESC, Location;
GO
/* ****************************************************************************
NEXT EXERCISE: a while back, we found the one-and-done users: people who
created an account, but then never logged in again. Just out of curiosity, did
any of them earn reputation points in that one brief login? Design an index for
this query - but before you do, take a look at the plan it's using now, and the
number of logical reads it's doing:
*/
SELECT TOP 100 CreationDate, LastAccessDate, DisplayName, Reputation, Id
  FROM dbo.Users
  WHERE CreationDate = LastAccessDate
    AND Reputation <> 1
  ORDER BY Reputation DESC;
GO
/* Huh. Interesting. Alright, your turn! Build the right index and prove it. */
/* ****************************************************************************
BONUS QUESTION: you've created a few indexes so far. Now, looking at those
indexes, try to craft a query that could maybe use those indexes, but won't.
For example, try to write one where the index doesn't quite cover, and make
SQL Server choose between an index seek + key lookup, versus a table scan, and
choose your filters carefully to make SQL Server think it's going to find so
much data that it's better off just scanning the clustered index instead.
*/
/* ****************************************************************************
BONUS QUESTION: write a query to find users who average the highest reputation
points gained per day. Who's rocketing up the fastest? Our report needs to show
their DisplayName, Location, and Reputation for the top 100 users in this
category, and sort them by the average highest points gained per day, desc.
