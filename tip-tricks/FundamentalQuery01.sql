T-SQL is a declarative language.
You usually declare the result set you're asking for,
but not how SQL Server assembles your results.
You CAN declare the way you want the data to be processed by specifying:
 * Hints like FORCEORDER
 * Which indexes you want to use
 * Whether SQL Server should seek or scan those indexes
But the more you specify, the more you miss out on cool optimizations,
especially in future versions where SQL Server keeps learning new tricks, or
when your database administrator (or you) add better indexes.
Back on your plan, right-click on the SELECT operator, and click Properties.
 * Compile CPU, Memory, Time
 * Optimization Level = Full means SQL Server put some thought into this
In a perfect world, SQL Server spends CPU & time analyzing what your query is
trying to do, and tries to build an execution plan quickly, making a tradeoff
between:
 * Time spent building an execution plan
 * Time executing the plan (and getting you your results)
But interestingly, SQL Server doesn't know whether you're going to run this
query just once, or millions of times. It does the best job it can, quickly,
and then moves on to its next task. It doesn't go back and refine that plan.
Our goals today are to:
 * Measure the work done when SQL Server executes the plan
 * Revisit the plan to see if it was appropriate, given the data inside the
   database and our query
 * Learn ways we can influence the plan (without forcing things)
