Fundamentals of Query Tuning: Common T-SQL Anti-Patterns

This demo requires:
* Any supported version of SQL Server
* Any Stack Overflow database: https://www.BrentOzar.com/go/querystack
This first RAISERROR is just to make sure you don't accidentally hit F5 and
run the entire script. You don't need to run this:

Different system functions behave differently,
especially in different places in the query.
There's no one truth about them all.
* Some overestimate, some under-estimate
* Some cause index scans, some don't
* Some are harmless, some are terribad
Generally speaking, avoid putting system functions
in the FROM/JOIN/WHERE/GROUP/etc unless you've
proven that the function placement is harmless in your
specific SQL Server version & compatibility level.

/* 
Implicit conversions: when SQL Server needs to compare two things, but the
datatypes aren't the same. Sometimes SQL Server can convert them automatically:
*/
DECLARE @Location XML = N'London, United Kingdom';
SELECT *
  FROM dbo.Users
  WHERE Location = @Location;
GO
/* Or try this: */
DECLARE @Location VARCHAR(100) = N'London, United Kingdom';
SELECT *
  FROM dbo.Users
  WHERE Location = @Location;
GO
/* Note - no warning in the plan.
Or this - note that I'm passing in a string, not a date:
*/
DECLARE @NotADate NVARCHAR(100) = N'2009-11-10';
SELECT *
  FROM dbo.Comments
  WHERE CreationDate = @NotADate;
GO
/* 
But if you pass in a higher-fidelity datatype than what's stored in the table:
*/
DECLARE @NotADate SQL_VARIANT = '2009-11-10';
SELECT *
  FROM dbo.Comments
  WHERE CreationDate = @NotADate;
GO
/* 
Things to think about:
 * SQL Server up-converts what's in the table to match the incoming data type
 * The CPU use goes up linearly with the number of rows/columns to be converted
 * We get a scan, not a seek
 * The estimates are usually way off, too
Granted, you probably never see people using SQL_VARIANT (and now you know why.)
Another example: comparing strings to numbers: */
SELECT *
    FROM dbo.Users
    WHERE Id = '26837';
/* No big deal. But try LIKE: */
SELECT *
    FROM dbo.Users
    WHERE Id LIKE '26837';
/* Because this also has to work: */
SELECT *
    FROM dbo.Users
    WHERE Id LIKE '26837%';
/* Read right to left, look at estimates,
and think about why they're off and what
you could do to fix 'em. */
/* The biggest offender is comparing VARCHAR
table contents to NVARCHAR parameters. Stack Overflow
doesn't ship with VARCHAR columns, so let's set one up:
*/
CREATE TABLE dbo.Users_Varchar (Id INT PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED, DisplayName VARCHAR(40));
INSERT INTO dbo.Users_Varchar (Id, DisplayName)
  SELECT Id, DisplayName
  FROM dbo.Users;
GO
CREATE INDEX IX_DisplayName ON dbo.Users_Varchar(DisplayName);
GO
/* Will our query use the index if we pass in an NVARCHAR?
The N in front of a string mean's it's Unicode (NVARCHAR).*/
SELECT *
  FROM dbo.Users_Varchar
  WHERE DisplayName = N'Brent Ozar';
GO
/* Things to think about:
* Read right to left, top to bottom
* Is there a yellow bang? What does it say?
If we fix it, how does the plan get better? 
*/
/* This can hit you really hard on joins, so check the fields you join on: */
WITH ProblematicColumns AS  (
SELECT COLUMN_NAME
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS c1
  GROUP BY COLUMN_NAME
  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT DATA_TYPE) > 1
)
SELECT c.*
  FROM ProblematicColumns pc

  ORDER BY c.COLUMN_NAME, c.DATA_TYPE;

/*
Things to think about:
 * How are estimates vs actuals?
 * What's the effect?
 * Can you fix the estimate by putting in indexes?
 * Can you imagine a scenario where this query runs very, very slowly?
 * How might you rework this query, either to fix the estimate, AND/OR reduce
   the blast radius of that bad estimate?
This is really the start of a lifelong journey.
The more you learn about SQL Server, the more
you'll start to recognize queries that COMPILE,
but produce bad estimations or behaviors.
